The GCC Talk app requires a GCC Talk server to function. GCC is a private, self-hosted file sync and communication platform, designed to put you back in control over your data. It runs on a server of your choice, be it at home, at a service provider or in your enterprise, and gives you access to your documents, calendars, contacts, email and other data. You can share with others even across different GCC servers and work together on documents. GCC is fully open source, giving you the option to extend them for your own use, participate in their development or simply verify they do what we promise.

Millions of users use GCC daily at businesses and homes around the world. Business users rely on the professional support of GCC GmbH, making sure they have a fully supported, enterprise-ready platform for productivity and collaboration, fully under control of their IT department.
